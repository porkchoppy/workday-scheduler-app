# Workday Scheduler App 

## Description
This repository links to a scheduler in which each hour of your workday has a text box to record tasks, which are then saved to local storage. The text boxes are color coded based on whether the hour is in the past, present, or future. The data entered into the text boxes is saved in local storage to retain said data when the page is refreshed. 


## Usage

Here is an example of the scheduler with data input and boxes color coded by past, present, and future time.
